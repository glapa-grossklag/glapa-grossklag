# Miles Glapa-Grossklag

Hello! :3

- I'm **studying computer science** at the University of California, Santa Cruz.
- I'm working on **GPU Software at Apple** as an intern.
- I'm helping out with [Twizzler](https://twizzler.io/), a **research operating system** developed by the [Center for Research in Storage Systems](https://www.crss.ucsc.edu) at UC Santa Cruz.
- I'm implementing impractical ideas on [GitHub](https://github.com/glapa-grossklag).

If you'd like to get in contact with me about any of the above (or anything, really), feel free to email me at `first_name@last_name.com`.
